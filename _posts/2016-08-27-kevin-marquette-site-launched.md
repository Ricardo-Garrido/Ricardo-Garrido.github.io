This is just a test post.
<!--more-->
This will be just a quick first test post. I am using github pages for this and using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This is a test of the markdown system

```posh
Get-Help markdown -examples
```

* first item
* second item

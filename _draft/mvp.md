Getting started with the MVP API

before we get started using the API, we need to signup for it. Go to https://mvpapi.portal.azure-api.net/ and sign in. If this is your first time signing in, then you will have to enter some basic registration infromation.

After you get signed in, click on the products tab. https://mvpapi.portal.azure-api.net/products and subscribe to the MVP Production API. You will see it on your profile page once you are subscribed.

After you put in a request for that subscription, you will need to wait for someone to approve you.

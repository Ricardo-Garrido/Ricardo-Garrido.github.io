Modules are a wonderful way to build a library of your common functions. In my last post, I broke down all the basic elements of what a module is. I left the reader with the idea that you place all of your functions into the `*.psm1`. You will see a lot of community modules where all of the functions are actually placed in sub folders.

I am going to take a moment to talk about why you would want to do that and show you how to set up your project for this type of approach. I am also going to take this one step further by adding a build script to combine all those functions into the `*.psm1` file and cover why you want to do that.

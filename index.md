## Blog\\Research

The primary focus of my [blog](/blog/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=index) is on PowerShell. I love to learn and research ideas in PowerShell. When I find something interesting or new, I write about those discoveries.

When I cover fundamentals, my intention is that everyone walks away learning something. My coverage on [hashtables](/2016-11-06-powershell-hashtable-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=index) gently introduces hashtables and continues on to take the topic to the most advanced details.
